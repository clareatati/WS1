            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> Road accidents on Uhuru Highway in Nairobi are predominantly caused by drunk driving and the challenging nature of roundabouts, especially on weekends. Despite various measures, the current systems fail to adequately control speeding and erratic driving, leading to frequent and severe accidents.
